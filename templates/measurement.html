          In the everyday world, determining the location of something—like, say, a brick—is as easy as sticking a GPS tracker on it. The same tracker could even provide a readout of the brick’s speed, showing how the location changes over time. You could keep the GPS tracker on the brick and set the whole mess on a scale to measure its weight, all while continuing to tick off the brick’s position. If you’re not easily bored, you could measure other properties of the brick—some changing, some not—and you could pretty much measure them all at the same time.

          That all goes out the window in the quantum world. Measurements of a quantum brick—if there were such a thing—wouldn’t be so simple. For instance, measuring the location of a quantum brick could give you precise knowledge of where it sits, but you would no longer have any clue how fast it was moving. Then, if you instead pinned down its speed, all of a sudden its location would be smeared out in space. In the quantum world, measurements change the quantum state of an object, and the order in which they’re done matters a lot.

          Another wrinkle is that even for simple quantum systems, it’s impossible to predict the outcome of a measurement with perfect certainty. The best you can do ahead of time is say what the probability of a certain result will be. This doesn’t help predict any one measurement, but it does tell you what will happen if you prepare the same quantum state and make the same measurement many times. The high degree to which this prediction matches what actually happens in experiments is a major source of our confidence that quantum physics really works.

        <p class="w-60-l w-100 mw7 mw9-ns center ml0-ns mr0-ns mt2 pr4">
          In one sense, quantum measurements are actually kind of intuitive. Consider what happens after you flip a coin but before you peek at the result. It’s got a 50-50 chance of being heads or tails. That’s a little bit like zapping an atom with a laser to prepare an equal superposition of two states. Once you actually look at the coin, that 50-50 split vanishes, and you’re 100% certain of the answer. Isn’t that kind of like what’s going on when you measure something like the quantum state of an atom?
        </p>
        
        <p class="w-60-l w-100 mw7 mw9-ns center ml0-ns mr0-ns mt2 pr4">
          Kind of, but quantum physics is stranger. No one would seriously doubt that before you look at the coin it is definitely either heads or tails. But if you try to play the same game with the atom, imagining that it really has one state or the other beforehand and the measurement merely reveals which, you’ll be in for a disappointment. Quantum states don’t behave like that: An atom has no determined state before it’s measured.

        <p class="w-60-l w-100 mw7 mw9-ns center ml0-ns mr0-ns mt2 pr4">
          Einstein at first famously rejected this whole idea of quantum indeterminacy. He insisted that quantum objects must have a complete set of properties—so far undiscovered—prior to any measurement. This idea is called “local realism”—local because it argues that an object’s properties are affected only by its immediate surroundings, and realism because an object has real, pre-existing properties before it is measured.
        </p>
        
        <p class="w-60-l w-100 mw7 mw9-ns center ml0-ns mr0-ns mt2 pr4">
          As it turns out, Einstein lost that argument. Since his contentious 1935 “EPR” article, scientists have produced an enormous body of experimental evidence supporting the view that objects have no specific properties before they are observed. Can’t win ‘em all.
