				<em>Spoiler alert:</em> The quintessential quantum property called "spin" has <em>almost nothing</em> to do with something like the Earth spinning around its axis. Nonetheless, spin is very real, and has profound effects on the world around us. It makes magnets magnetic, determines the layout of the periodic table and makes MRI scans possible, to name a few.

          The term derives from an early, reasonable, and dead wrong explanation of experiments that showed electrons (and their associated atoms) seemed to behave like miniature magnets. In the classical world, an electrically charged object spinning around an axis produces north and south magnetic poles. So in the 1920s, scientists proposed that the negatively charged electron might be doing the same.

					<span class="sidenote side f7 sans-serif lh-copy gray fr pr6 pl5 mb3 mt3 pa0-l ma0-l mt1" id="sidenote-1"><span class="f6 pb2 blue relative" style="">⊕ </span>You may see spin described as a kind of angular momentum, the same property that makes it hard to change the direction of a spinning gyroscope or keeps a bicycle going straight when you take your hands off the handlebars. Actually, quantum particles such as the electron have two different kinds of angular momentum. One, which is similar to the gyroscope, derives from the electron’s orbit around an atomic nucleus. That is called orbital angular momentum. Spin, although it involves no rotation, is called <em>intrinsic</em> angular momentum. Both are expressed in the same units used to describe gyroscopes and bike wheels.</span>For one thing, physicists soon determined, the electron would have to be spinning much faster than the speed of light (not allowed in this cosmos) to produce its measured properties. For another, it turns out that the electron has no actual size. It’s a dimensionless “point particle,” with no observed structure down to a billionth of a billionth of a meter. It couldn’t spin if it wanted to. Weirder still, even electrically neutral particles such as neutrons act like miniature magnets.
        </p>
        
        <p class="w-60-l w-100 mw7 mw9-ns center ml0-ns mr0-ns mt2 pr4">
				But in many ways, quantum particles <em>behave</em> as if they are spinning. Each electron has a magnetic dipole, as if produced by a spinning charge, with only two possible orientations: “spin up” or “spin down.” A collection of atoms in which most of the spins are aligned the same way is magnetic; the greater the degree of alignment, the stronger the magnetic field. Conversely, materials with equal numbers of electrons in each orientation are non-magnetic.
        </p>
        
        <p class="w-60-l w-100 mw7 mw9-ns center ml0-ns mr0-ns mt2 pr4">
          But that is where any comparison to physical rotation abruptly ends. Spin is exactly quantized (footnote spot), and separates every particle in the universe into two categories, depending on whether their spin is an integer like 1 or a half-integer like 1/2. You’re either a boson or a fermion. There are no other options. (We should add a footnote here about anyons.)

        <p class="w-60-l w-100 mw7 mw9-ns center ml0-ns mr0-ns mt2 pr4">
          <b>Bosons</b> are particles that convey forces. The photon, for example, transmits the electromagnetic force. Any number of bosons with identical properties can exist in the same place at the same time. That’s why you don’t see laser beams pushing each other out of the way: The photons that comprise them are happy to pass through one another without a thought.

          It’s a different story for half-integer spin objects, such as electrons, which belong to the second particle family: <b>fermions</b>. They are the basic components of matter, and follow very different rules. <span class="blue selector" onclick="toggle('sidenote-2')">Nature prohibits fermions<span class="f6 pb2 relative" style="top:-.5rem;">⊕</span></span>

It also determines when a given level is “full,” after which any additional electron must go to the next highest level. The organization of the Periodic Table follows the exclusion principle: Elements in each vertical column have similar chemical properties because they have similar electron configurations.</span> with identical properties from occupying the same quantum state in the same system.

				At first, that might seem to forbid the existence of, say, two electrons in the same <b>orbital</b> of an atom, which would put helium entirely out of business. Spin saves the day. Two electrons <em>can</em> occupy the same orbital, but only if one is spin up and the other spin down.

          Spin may be a uniquely quantum phenomenon, but it has many real-world practical applications. One of the best known is medical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The human body is full of protons. (Think of all those Hs in H<sub>2</sub>O.) So when a strong magnetic field is applied to a patient inside an MRI machine, the protons in the patient’s body align their spins with the field. Then pulses of radio-frequency waves are sent through the body, altering the proton spins. Between pulses, the proton spins “relax” back to their original conditions, giving off signals that are collected and used to build up an image.
